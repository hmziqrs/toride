# Lima Sandbox Runbook

This document defines how Toride should use Lima for destructive Linux testing.

Toride is a guided VPS setup tool. Its apply path will intentionally mutate a machine: package manager state, users, groups, SSH daemon configuration, firewall rules, Docker, services, files under `/etc`, and sometimes reboot-required state. The sandbox must therefore be a real Linux VM that can be destroyed or restored quickly.

Lima is the preferred local sandbox runner because it is CLI-first, lightweight on macOS, supports multiple Linux distributions, provides SSH access, file sharing, port forwarding, and snapshot commands, and can be driven by an AI agent without a GUI.

Audit status:

* Lima is not installed in the current development workspace, so local command execution could not be validated here.
* Commands, flags, template names, mounts, VZ behavior, `copy`, `validate`, and snapshot syntax in this document were cross-checked against Lima's current public docs on 2026-05-14.
* Lima snapshots are documented but marked experimental by Lima. Scripts must support a delete-and-recreate fallback.
* The sandbox flow is workable for the current repo state, but Toride itself is not implemented yet beyond `src/main.rs`. The destructive apply examples describe the intended CLI once Toride has apply/dry-run commands.
* The biggest project-specific risk is SSH/firewall testing: Lima uses SSH for `limactl shell` and `limactl copy`, so a Toride run that breaks guest SSH may also break artifact collection.

---

# Goals

The Lima sandbox must support:

* Repeated destructive Toride runs without damaging the host.
* Fast reset back to a known-clean baseline.
* Multiple target distributions.
* Real `systemd`, real package managers, real users, real services, and real network behavior.
* Host-to-guest binary transfer for locally built Toride artifacts.
* Agent-friendly commands that can be scripted without opening a GUI.
* Clear teardown when a VM is corrupted beyond repair.

The sandbox is not a substitute for unit tests, dry-run tests, or PTY E2E tests. It is the destructive integration layer.

---

# Recommended Distro Matrix

Toride should keep a small but representative matrix.

## Primary

These should be tested before trusting a release:

* Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 26.04 LTS
* Debian 12
* Debian 13

## Secondary

These are important for later compatibility work:

* Rocky Linux 9
* Rocky Linux 10

## Optional Later

Add only after the primary matrix is reliable:

* AlmaLinux 9 / 10
* Fedora Server
* openSUSE Leap
* Arch Linux

---

# Why Not Docker

Docker containers are useful for narrow tests, but they are not the main sandbox for Toride.

Containers do not reliably match VPS behavior for:

* `systemd`
* SSH daemon lifecycle
* UFW and nftables behavior
* Docker installation and Docker-in-Docker
* kernel modules and cgroups
* reboot-required state
* service enablement
* cloud-init behavior
* package lock timing on fresh boot

Use containers only for command rendering, package detection, and dry-run checks. Use Lima VMs for destructive apply tests.

---

# Host Requirements

Assumed host:

* macOS
* Homebrew installed
* Enough disk for multiple VM disks
* Apple Silicon or Intel Mac

Install Lima:

```bash
brew install lima
```

Verify:

```bash
limactl --version
limactl list
limactl start --list-templates
```

The scripts should require Lima 2.x or newer for this plan. If `ubuntu-26.04`, `debian-13`, `rocky-10`, `--mount-none`, or `snapshot` are missing, upgrade Lima before continuing.

On macOS, prefer Lima's native virtualization backend where possible:

```yaml
vmType: vz
```

If a guest image fails under `vz`, fall back to QEMU for that distro:

```yaml
vmType: qemu
```

For automation, prefer non-interactive Lima commands:

```bash
limactl start --tty=false ...
limactl create --tty=false ...
```

`--tty=false` disables Lima's TUI/editor prompts. Some Lima docs still show `-y` / `--yes`, but Lima's deprecation notes mark `--yes` as deprecated in the 2.x line, so scripts should use `--tty=false`.

---

# Directory Layout

Use a repo-local sandbox directory for templates and agent scripts:

```text
dev/
`-- sandbox/
    `-- lima/
        |-- README.md
        |-- images/
        |   |-- ubuntu-24.04/
        |   |-- ubuntu-26.04/
        |   |-- debian-12/
        |   |-- debian-13/
        |   |-- rocky-9/
        |   `-- rocky-10/
        |-- templates/
        |   |-- ubuntu-24.04.yaml
        |   |-- ubuntu-26.04.yaml
        |   |-- debian-12.yaml
        |   |-- debian-13.yaml
        |   |-- rocky-9.yaml
        |   `-- rocky-10.yaml
        `-- scripts/
            |-- create.sh
            |-- reset.sh
            |-- run.sh
            |-- destroy.sh
            `-- matrix.sh
```

The user may provide initial images under `dev/sandbox/lima/images/<distro>/`. The agent should use those images when present. If no local image is present, the agent may use a Lima built-in template or an official cloud image URL.

Do not commit large VM image files. Add this ignore rule when the directory is created:

```gitignore
dev/sandbox/lima/images/**/*.qcow2
dev/sandbox/lima/images/**/*.img
dev/sandbox/lima/images/**/*.raw
dev/sandbox/lima/images/**/*.iso
```

---

# Image Input Contract

The AI agent expects each supplied image directory to contain:

```text
dev/sandbox/lima/images/<distro>/
|-- image-aarch64.qcow2
|-- image-x86_64.qcow2
`-- SHA256SUMS
```

Preferred image format:

* `qcow2` cloud image with cloud-init support

Accepted with caveats:

* `.img` cloud image
* `.raw` disk image

Do not use ISO installer images for the normal test loop. Lima distribution templates are built around cloud-style disk images. ISO installation is slower, less reproducible, harder for an agent to automate, and should be treated as a separate manual image-building task.

The `SHA256SUMS` file should contain a hash for the image:

```text
<sha256>  image-aarch64.qcow2
<sha256>  image-x86_64.qcow2
```

Verify before use:

```bash
cd dev/sandbox/lima/images/ubuntu-24.04
shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS
```

If only one architecture is provided, the template for that distro must set `arch` to that architecture and must not pretend the same image supports both `aarch64` and `x86_64`.

For Apple Silicon Macs, use `aarch64` images by default. Use `x86_64` only when testing x86-specific behavior, and expect it to be slower because it requires emulation. For Intel Macs, use `x86_64`.

Cross-architecture testing on Apple Silicon should use QEMU:

```yaml
vmType: qemu
arch: x86_64
```

Native-architecture testing should use `vz` where possible.

---

# Instance Naming

Use stable names:

```text
toride-u2404
toride-u2604
toride-d12
toride-d13
toride-r9
toride-r10
```

Do not use random instance names in scripts. Stable names make cleanup and agent recovery simpler.

---

# Baseline Lifecycle

Every distro follows the same lifecycle:

1. Create VM from template.
2. Boot VM.
3. Wait for cloud-init and package manager locks.
4. Install only baseline tools needed for testing.
5. Stop VM.
6. Create `clean` snapshot.
7. For each destructive test, restore `clean`, start, run Toride, collect logs.
8. Destroy and recreate if restore cannot recover the VM.

The important invariant:

> Toride apply tests always start from the `clean` snapshot.

Do not install Toride or developer build tools into the destructive test VM before creating `clean`. Build tools belong on the host or in a separate builder VM.

---

# Generic Lima Template

Use this as the baseline shape for templates.

```yaml
# dev/sandbox/lima/templates/ubuntu-24.04.yaml
minimumLimaVersion: "2.0.0"
vmType: vz
arch: default
cpus: 2
memory: 4GiB
disk: 24GiB

images:
  - location: "/ABS/PATH/TO/dev/sandbox/lima/images/ubuntu-24.04/image-aarch64.qcow2"
    arch: "aarch64"
  - location: "/ABS/PATH/TO/dev/sandbox/lima/images/ubuntu-24.04/image-x86_64.qcow2"
    arch: "x86_64"

mounts: []

containerd:
  system: false
  user: false

provision:
  - mode: system
    script: |
      set -eux
      if command -v cloud-init >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        cloud-init status --wait || true
      fi
      if command -v apt-get >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
        apt-get update
        apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl sudo openssh-server systemd systemd-sysv iproute2
      elif command -v dnf >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        dnf install -y ca-certificates curl sudo openssh-server systemd iproute
      fi
      systemctl enable ssh || systemctl enable sshd || true
      systemctl start ssh || systemctl start sshd || true
```

Notes:

* Host mounts are disabled by default. This is intentional: destructive guest commands should not receive direct filesystem access to the host repo.
* Copy test binaries into `/tmp` or `/opt/toride-test` inside the guest before running them.
* Use absolute local image paths in generated YAML. This avoids ambiguity about whether Lima resolves relative paths from the repo root, current shell directory, or template location.
* Use `4GiB` memory by default. Increase to `6GiB` or `8GiB` for Ubuntu 26.04 if heavy package flows become slow.
* For Rocky 10, verify the image supports the host CPU architecture. Rocky 10 changed some architecture baselines on x86.
* If a distro only works under QEMU, change `vmType` to `qemu`. Do not use QEMU `9p` mounts with Rocky/Alma-style guests; Lima documents 9p incompatibility with those kernels.

---

# Built-In Template Fallback

If no user-supplied image exists, use Lima's templates where available:

```bash
limactl start --tty=false --name=toride-u2404 --mount-none template:ubuntu-24.04
limactl start --tty=false --name=toride-u2604 --mount-none template:ubuntu-26.04
limactl start --tty=false --name=toride-d12 --mount-none template:debian-12
limactl start --tty=false --name=toride-d13 --mount-none template:debian-13
limactl start --tty=false --name=toride-r9 --mount-none template:rocky-9
limactl start --tty=false --name=toride-r10 --mount-none template:rocky-10
```

Template names can change by Lima version. The agent must check available templates before assuming a name:

```bash
limactl start --list-templates
```

If the exact distro template is missing, use a custom YAML with an official cloud image URL or ask the user for the image.

Do not use `template:ubuntu` for the Ubuntu LTS test lane. Lima's `ubuntu` alias may point at the newest interim release, not the LTS version Toride wants to validate.

Do not use `template:default` for destructive Toride tests. It is convenient for general Lima use, but it includes Lima's default container tooling and defaults that are not as close to a fresh VPS as the versioned distro templates.

---

# Creating a VM

From the repo root:

```bash
limactl create --tty=false --name=toride-u2404 --mount-none dev/sandbox/lima/templates/ubuntu-24.04.yaml
limactl start toride-u2404
```

Check status:

```bash
limactl list
limactl shell toride-u2404 uname -a
limactl shell toride-u2404 cat /etc/os-release
```

Check `systemd`:

```bash
limactl shell toride-u2404 systemctl is-system-running
```

`degraded` is acceptable immediately after boot if the failed unit is irrelevant to the test. `offline` or `Failed to connect to bus` is not acceptable for Toride integration testing.

---

# Creating the Clean Snapshot

After the baseline setup finishes:

```bash
limactl stop toride-u2404
limactl snapshot create toride-u2404 --tag clean
limactl snapshot list toride-u2404
```

The `clean` snapshot should represent a fresh VPS-like state:

* package metadata updated once
* SSH server installed and running
* sudo available
* no Toride changes applied
* no Docker installed unless the base cloud image already includes it
* no UFW changes unless the base cloud image already includes them
* no extra users except image defaults

Do not create a snapshot after running Toride unless it is explicitly named for debugging.

---

# Resetting Before Every Test

Before every destructive apply test:

```bash
limactl stop toride-u2404 || true
limactl snapshot apply toride-u2404 --tag clean
limactl start toride-u2404
```

Then verify the guest identity:

```bash
limactl shell toride-u2404 cat /etc/os-release
limactl shell toride-u2404 id
limactl shell toride-u2404 systemctl is-system-running || true
```

The agent should treat failed snapshot restore as a reason to destroy and recreate the instance.

Because Lima snapshots are experimental, every script must support this slower fallback:

```bash
limactl stop toride-u2404 || true
limactl delete -f toride-u2404
limactl create --tty=false --name=toride-u2404 --mount-none dev/sandbox/lima/templates/ubuntu-24.04.yaml
limactl start toride-u2404
limactl stop toride-u2404
limactl snapshot create toride-u2404 --tag clean
limactl start toride-u2404
```

If snapshots prove unreliable for a given Lima version or VM driver, delete-and-recreate becomes the canonical reset path for that lane.

When using delete-and-recreate as the reset path, scripts should cache downloaded images through Lima's normal cache and avoid deleting user-supplied images. The VM disk is disposable; the source image is not.

---

# Snapshots Are Not Backups

For Toride testing, a Lima snapshot is a fast local reset point, not a durable backup.

Keep these durable inputs instead:

* the original user-supplied cloud image
* the image checksum file
* the generated Lima template
* sandbox scripts
* collected test artifacts

If a VM becomes valuable for debugging, export evidence from it before deleting it:

```bash
mkdir -p .sandbox-artifacts/toride-u2404/debug
limactl shell toride-u2404 journalctl -b --no-pager > .sandbox-artifacts/toride-u2404/debug/journal.txt
limactl shell toride-u2404 systemctl --failed --no-pager > .sandbox-artifacts/toride-u2404/debug/systemd-failed.txt
limactl shell toride-u2404 cat /etc/os-release > .sandbox-artifacts/toride-u2404/debug/os-release.txt
```

Do not depend on snapshots to move state between machines. Recreate VMs from images and templates instead.

---

# Running Toride in the Guest

Do not copy `target/release/toride` from a macOS host into the Linux guest. That binary is a macOS binary and will not execute in Linux.

Recommended build path: produce static Linux binaries on the host, matching the guest architecture. This aligns with Toride's release plan for `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` and `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`.

Install the cross-build tooling once on the host:

```bash
brew install zig
cargo install cargo-zigbuild
rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-musl
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
```

Build both Linux binaries:

```bash
cargo zigbuild --release --target aarch64-unknown-linux-musl
cargo zigbuild --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
```

Select the binary that matches the guest:

```bash
limactl shell toride-u2404 uname -m
```

Mapping:

```text
aarch64 -> target/aarch64-unknown-linux-musl/release/toride
x86_64  -> target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/toride
```

Copy into the guest:

```bash
limactl copy ./target/aarch64-unknown-linux-musl/release/toride toride-u2404:/tmp/toride
limactl shell toride-u2404 chmod +x /tmp/toride
```

Verify it is executable in Linux:

```bash
limactl shell toride-u2404 /tmp/toride --version || limactl shell toride-u2404 /tmp/toride
```

Run dry-run first:

```bash
limactl shell toride-u2404 /tmp/toride --dry-run
```

Run apply only after dry-run is sane:

```bash
limactl shell toride-u2404 sudo /tmp/toride apply --profile sandbox
```

If Toride is interactive-only at that point in development, run an interactive shell:

```bash
limactl shell toride-u2404
sudo /tmp/toride
```

The final scripted CLI shape may change as Toride evolves. The sandbox contract should remain stable: reset, copy binary, run dry-run, run apply, collect logs.

Current repo reality: as of this document, `src/main.rs` only prints `Hello, world!`. The sandbox can already validate that a Linux binary transfers and executes, but it cannot validate destructive Toride behavior until the executor and CLI commands exist.

Fallback build path: if host cross-compilation is blocked, build inside a separate non-destructive builder VM, not inside the clean destructive test VM. The destructive VM should start as close to a fresh VPS as possible before Toride runs.

---

# SSH And Firewall Risk

Lima controls Linux guests through SSH. That means these commands depend on a working guest SSH path:

```bash
limactl shell <instance> ...
limactl copy <source> <instance>:<target>
```

Toride modules that touch SSH, UFW, nftables, Fail2Ban, users, or sudo can break the same control path the sandbox uses.

The test flow must therefore split destructive runs into phases:

1. **Smoke phase**: run modules that do not modify SSH or firewall rules.
2. **Firewall phase**: enable firewall modules only after Toride proves SSH remains allowed.
3. **SSH-hardening phase**: disable root/password login only after an independent reconnect command succeeds.
4. **Recovery phase**: if Lima SSH is broken, stop using `limactl shell` for diagnosis and reset from snapshot or delete-and-recreate.

For SSH-hardening tests, Toride must print and verify a reconnect command before applying irreversible changes:

```bash
SSH_CONFIG="$(limactl list --format '{{.SSHConfigFile}}' toride-u2404)"
ssh -F "$SSH_CONFIG" lima-toride-u2404 true
```

Lima's documented SSH host alias is `lima-<instance>`, for example `lima-default` for the `default` instance. If that exact alias is not available in the installed Lima version, get the connection details from Lima and generate the equivalent command:

```bash
limactl list toride-u2404
limactl show-ssh toride-u2404
```

`limactl show-ssh` is deprecated in current Lima docs, but it remains useful as a fallback when building a reconnect command. Prefer SSH config files under `~/.lima/<instance>/` when available.

Any test profile that includes SSH or firewall modules must be allowed to break the VM. The reset mechanism is the recovery path.

---

# Collecting Logs

Create a host artifact directory:

```bash
mkdir -p .sandbox-artifacts/toride-u2404
```

Collect guest state:

```bash
limactl shell toride-u2404 journalctl -b --no-pager > .sandbox-artifacts/toride-u2404/journal.txt
limactl shell toride-u2404 systemctl --failed --no-pager > .sandbox-artifacts/toride-u2404/systemd-failed.txt
limactl shell toride-u2404 cat /etc/os-release > .sandbox-artifacts/toride-u2404/os-release.txt
limactl shell toride-u2404 ss -tulpn > .sandbox-artifacts/toride-u2404/ports.txt
```

For Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
limactl shell toride-u2404 sudo tail -n 300 /var/log/apt/history.log > .sandbox-artifacts/toride-u2404/apt-history.txt
limactl shell toride-u2404 sudo tail -n 500 /var/log/dpkg.log > .sandbox-artifacts/toride-u2404/dpkg.txt
```

For Rocky:

```bash
limactl shell toride-r10 sudo dnf history > .sandbox-artifacts/toride-r10/dnf-history.txt
limactl shell toride-r10 rpm -qa > .sandbox-artifacts/toride-r10/rpm-qa.txt
```

If Toride writes its own logs, copy those too:

```bash
limactl shell toride-u2404 -- bash -lc 'find ~/.local/state ~/.cache /var/log -iname "*toride*" 2>/dev/null'
```

---

# Destroying a Broken VM

If a test breaks SSH, systemd, package management, or Lima connectivity:

```bash
limactl stop toride-u2404 || true
limactl delete -f toride-u2404
```

Then recreate from template and remake the clean snapshot.

Do not spend time manually repairing a sandbox unless the broken state is the bug being investigated.

---

# Script Contracts

The future `dev/sandbox/lima/scripts/` commands should be thin wrappers around Lima.

## create.sh

Create or recreate one instance.

```bash
dev/sandbox/lima/scripts/create.sh ubuntu-24.04
```

Expected behavior:

* validates Lima is installed
* validates the Lima version has `snapshot`, `copy`, `start --list-templates`, and `--mount-none`
* validates the required template is present with `limactl start --list-templates`
* validates the template exists
* runs `limactl validate <template>`
* validates the image checksum when using local images
* creates the named instance
* starts it
* waits for boot readiness
* creates the `clean` snapshot, replacing an existing clean snapshot only after explicit `--recreate`

## reset.sh

Restore an instance to `clean`.

```bash
dev/sandbox/lima/scripts/reset.sh ubuntu-24.04
```

Expected behavior:

* stops the VM if needed
* applies `clean`
* starts the VM
* checks `/etc/os-release`
* checks `systemd`
* falls back to delete-and-recreate when snapshots are unavailable or fail

## run.sh

Run Toride in one VM.

```bash
dev/sandbox/lima/scripts/run.sh ubuntu-24.04 --profile sandbox
```

Expected behavior:

* builds or accepts a host binary path
* rejects macOS binaries before copying to the guest
* checks guest architecture with `uname -m`
* resets the VM first
* copies the binary into `/tmp/toride`
* verifies `/tmp/toride` executes before running tests
* runs dry-run
* optionally runs apply
* collects artifacts

## matrix.sh

Run a command against multiple VMs.

```bash
dev/sandbox/lima/scripts/matrix.sh ubuntu-24.04 debian-13 rocky-10
```

Expected behavior:

* runs each distro independently
* keeps artifacts separate
* continues after a distro fails unless `--fail-fast` is passed
* exits non-zero if any distro failed

## destroy.sh

Delete one instance.

```bash
dev/sandbox/lima/scripts/destroy.sh ubuntu-24.04
```

Expected behavior:

* stops the VM if needed
* deletes the VM
* does not delete user-supplied images
* does not delete artifacts unless `--artifacts` is passed

---

# Agent Safety Rules

An AI agent operating these sandboxes must follow these rules:

* Never run Toride apply directly on the macOS host.
* Never mount the repo writable into a destructive guest by default.
* Never reuse a VM for apply testing without restoring `clean` first.
* Never assume a distro from the instance name; check `/etc/os-release`.
* Never assume `systemd` works; check it.
* Never assume `apt` or `dnf` locks are free immediately after boot.
* Never assume Lima SSH will survive SSH-hardening or firewall tests.
* Never run a macOS-built Toride binary in the Linux guest.
* Never repair a broken sandbox manually unless debugging that exact failure.
* Never commit downloaded VM images or generated VM disks.
* Always collect logs before destroying a failed VM when possible.

---

# Validation Checklist

Each sandbox image is acceptable when these pass:

```bash
limactl shell <instance> cat /etc/os-release
limactl shell <instance> uname -m
limactl shell <instance> systemctl is-system-running || true
limactl shell <instance> command -v sudo
limactl shell <instance> command -v curl
limactl shell <instance> -- bash -lc 'command -v sshd || command -v ssh'
```

For Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
limactl shell <instance> command -v apt-get
limactl shell <instance> sudo apt-get update
limactl shell <instance> -- bash -lc 'test ! -e /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend'
```

For Rocky:

```bash
limactl shell <instance> command -v dnf
limactl shell <instance> sudo dnf makecache
```

Snapshot validation:

```bash
limactl stop <instance>
limactl snapshot create <instance> --tag clean
limactl snapshot apply <instance> --tag clean
limactl start <instance>
limactl shell <instance> cat /etc/os-release
```

Binary validation:

```bash
limactl shell <instance> uname -m
limactl copy ./target/<linux-target>/release/toride <instance>:/tmp/toride
limactl shell <instance> chmod +x /tmp/toride
limactl shell <instance> /tmp/toride
```

# Distro-Specific Notes

## Ubuntu 24.04 LTS

This should be the first and most frequently used sandbox. It is a current common VPS baseline and already listed as a Toride target.

Recommended resources:

```text
2 CPU
4 GiB memory
24 GiB disk
```

## Ubuntu 26.04 LTS

Use this as the forward-looking Ubuntu target. It may require more memory for heavier flows.

Recommended resources:

```text
2 CPU
6 GiB memory
32 GiB disk
```

## Debian 12

Use this as the conservative Debian target. It remains important for existing VPS providers and older production machines.

Recommended resources:

```text
2 CPU
3 GiB memory
20 GiB disk
```

## Debian 13

Use this as the current Debian stable target.

Recommended resources:

```text
2 CPU
4 GiB memory
24 GiB disk
```

## Rocky Linux 9

Use this for RHEL-compatible behavior with mature package support.

Recommended resources:

```text
2 CPU
4 GiB memory
24 GiB disk
```

## Rocky Linux 10

Use this for current RHEL-compatible behavior. Verify architecture compatibility early, especially on Intel hosts, because newer enterprise distributions may raise CPU baselines.

Recommended resources:

```text
2 CPU
4 GiB memory
24 GiB disk
```

# Failure Modes To Expect

## Cloud-init still running

Fresh cloud images may still be initializing when the agent connects.

Check:

```bash
limactl shell <instance> cloud-init status --wait
```

## Package manager locks

APT and DNF can be busy immediately after boot.

Toride itself should handle this, but sandbox scripts may also wait before test setup.

## SSH service name differs

Debian/Ubuntu often use `ssh`; Rocky commonly uses `sshd`.

Use both:

```bash
systemctl status ssh || systemctl status sshd
```

## systemd degraded

Some cloud images boot with harmless degraded units. Capture the failed unit list before deciding:

```bash
systemctl --failed --no-pager
```

## Snapshot chain gets slow

Long snapshot chains can hurt performance. Keep only:

* `clean`
* one temporary debug snapshot when actively investigating

Delete old debug snapshots.

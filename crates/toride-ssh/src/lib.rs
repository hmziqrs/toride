//! `toride-ssh` — async SSH manager library.
//!
//! This is the **facade crate** that re-exports all sub-crates behind a
//! unified API. The entry point is [`SshManager`], which resolves `~/.ssh`
//! paths and provides accessor methods for each subsystem.
//!
//! # Subsystem accessors
//!
//! - [`SshManager::keys`] — key generation, inventory, repair
//! - [`SshManager::config`] — config parsing, editing, resolution
//! - [`SshManager::agent`] — SSH agent interaction *(feature: `agent`)*
//! - [`SshManager::authorized_keys`] — authorized_keys management *(feature: `authorized-keys`)*
//! - [`SshManager::doctor`] — diagnostic checks *(feature: `doctor`)*
//! - [`SshManager::known_hosts`] — known_hosts management *(feature: `known-hosts`)*
//! - [`SshManager::forward`] — port forwarding via ControlMaster *(feature: `forward`)*
//! - [`SshManager::certificate`] — SSH certificate/CA operations *(feature: `certificate`)*
//!
//! # Testing with a custom CLI runner
//!
//! Use [`SshManager::with_cli_runner`] to inject a [`MockCliRunner`] so that
//! no real SSH processes are spawned during tests.

// Re-export core types (Error, Result, SshKey, CliRunner, etc.)

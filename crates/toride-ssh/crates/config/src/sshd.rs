//! Editing of `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` for access-control directives.

//! read/edit operations for the user-access directives Toride cares about:
//! `AllowUsers` and `DenyUsers`.
//!
//! Writes are privileged (the file is root-owned) and go through
//! [`toride_ssh_core::run_privileged`], which validates the result with

//! sshd_config would lock the user out of SSH, so an invalid config is never

//! — editing them blindly is dangerous, and global scope is what we expose in
//! the UI.
